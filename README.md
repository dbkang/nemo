Nemo
====

Nemo is a basic spreadsheet application written in Scala using Swing.  Unlike in Excel, where the scripting language and the formula language are distinct, a single language, Nemoscript, is used for both formulas and application scripting.  Nemoscript is a simple functional language inspired by Scheme.  Another feature over Excel is that in Nemo, arbitrary objects, including functions, XML and images can be stored in cells - any valid value in Nemoscript can be stored in cells.
